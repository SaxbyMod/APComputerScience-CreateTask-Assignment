# Book Reader

## Installation: 

1. Grab either the latest release or build the repo.
2. Where the executable is make a file called `Save.txt` this is the file that saves the books within.
3. In that sane folder there should be a folder called `Books` if it is not present than make one and place books from the Book Release into the folder [Unzip the zips].
4. Run the Executable than it should run as intended.

## How To Use:

### Reading;

1. Run the Executable.
2. Enter the title of the book you want to read as listed in the console.
3. Read away, Note: `<` means go to the prior page `X` means close the page and `>` means go to the next page in the book.

### Writing:

1. Open The `Books` Folder.
2. Make a new folder with any name you want, Just cannot be the same as one already in the folder.
3. Starting at `0.txt` make new text files for each page in the the book the maximum amount of lines per page is `35` with a max line length of `86`.

## To-Do:

* Add a way to make text Italic/Bold/Strikethrough.
* Add a system where you can download books from online.
* Add a way for the program to default to open a certain book if its the only option present in the `Books` folder.
* Maybe rehaul the UI with animations somehow(?).
