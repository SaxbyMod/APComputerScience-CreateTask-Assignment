In the year 1878 I took my degree of
Doctor of Medicine of the University of
London, and proceeded to Netley to go
through the course prescribed for sur-
geons in the army. Having completed my studies
there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northum-
berland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regi-
ment was stationed in India at the time, and before
I could join it, the second Afghan war had bro-
ken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my
corps had advanced through the passes, and was
already deep in the enemyâ€™s country. I followed,
however, with many other officers who were in the
same situation as myself, and succeeded in reach-
ing Candahar in safety, where I found my regi-
ment, and at once entered upon my new duties.
The campaign brought honours and promotion
to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune
and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and
attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at
the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck
on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shat-
tered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery.
I should have fallen into the hands of the murder-
ous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and
courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw
me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing
me safely to the British lines.
Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged
hardships which I had undergone, I was removed,
with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base
hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had al-
ready improved so far as to be able to walk about
the wards, and even to bask a little upon the ve-
randah, when I was struck down by enteric fever,
that curse of our Indian possessions. For months
my life was despaired of, and when at last I came
to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak
and emaciated that a medical board determined
that not a day should be lost in sending me back
to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the
troopship Orontes, and landed a month later on
Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ru-
ined, but with permission from a paternal govern-
ment to spend the next nine months in attempting
to improve it.
