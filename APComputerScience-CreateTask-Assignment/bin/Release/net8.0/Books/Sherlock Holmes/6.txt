“There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frank-
fort last year. He would certainly have been hung
had this test been in existence. Then there was
Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and
Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of new Or-
leans. I could name a score of cases in which it
would have been decisive.”
“You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,”
said Stamford with a laugh. “You might start a pa-
per on those lines. Call it the ‘Police News of the
Past.’ ”
“Very interesting reading it might be made,
too,” remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small
piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. “I have
to be careful,” he continued, turning to me with a
smile, “for I dabble with poisons a good deal.” He
held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it
was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster,
and discoloured with strong acids.
“We came here on business,” said Stamford, sit-
ting down on a high three-legged stool, and push-
ing another one in my direction with his foot. “My
friend here wants to take diggings, and as you
were complaining that you could get no one to go
halves with you, I thought that I had better bring
you together.”
Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea
of sharing his rooms with me. “I have my eye on a
suite in Baker Street,” he said, “which would suit
us down to the ground. You don’t mind the smell
of strong tobacco, I hope?”
“I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself,” I answered.
“That’s good enough. I generally have chem-
icals about, and occasionally do experiments.
Would that annoy you?”
“By no means.”
“Let me see—what are my other shortcomings.
I get in the dumps at times, and don’t open my
mouth for days on end. You must not think I am
sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I’ll
soon be right. What have you to confess now? It’s
just as well for two fellows to know the worst of
one another before they begin to live together.”
