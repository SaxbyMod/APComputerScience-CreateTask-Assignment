"It is interesting, chemically, no doubt," I answered, "but practically—"

"Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years. Don’t you see that it 
gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come over here now!" He seized me by the coat 
sleeve in his eagerness and drew me over to the table at which he had been working. "Let us 
have some fresh blood," he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the 
resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. "Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a 
litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The 
proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we 
shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction." As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a 
few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant, the 
contents assumed a dull mahogany color, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of 
the glass jar.

"Ha! ha!" he cried, clapping his hands and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy. 
"What do you think of that?"

"It seems to be a very delicate test," I remarked.

"Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So is the 
microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if the stains are a few 
hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been 
invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the 
penalty of their crimes."

"Indeed!" I murmured.

"Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is suspected of a crime months 
perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains 
discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or 
what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no 
reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty."

His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some 
applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.
