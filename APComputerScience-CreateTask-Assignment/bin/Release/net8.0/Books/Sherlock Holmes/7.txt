"Let me see—what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at times and don’t open my mouth for days 
on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. What have 
you to confess now? It’s just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to 
live together."

I laughed at this cross-examination. "I keep a bull pup," I said, "and I object to rows because my nerves 
are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices 
when I’m well, but those are the principal ones at present."

"Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?" he asked, anxiously.

"It depends on the player," I answered. "A well-played violin is a treat for the gods—a badly-played one—"

"Oh, that’s all right," he cried, with a merry laugh. "I think we may consider the thing as settled—that is, 
if the rooms are agreeable to you."

"When shall we see them?"

"Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settle everything," he answered.


"All right—noon exactly," said I, shaking his hand.

We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards my hotel.

"By the way," I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, "how the deuce did he know 
that I had come from Afghanistan?"

My companion smiled an enigmatical smile.

"That’s just his little peculiarity," he said. "A good many people have wanted to know how he 
finds things out."

"Oh! a mystery is it?" I cried, rubbing my hands. "This is very piquant. I am much obliged to 
you for bringing us together. ‘The proper study of mankind is man,’ you know."
