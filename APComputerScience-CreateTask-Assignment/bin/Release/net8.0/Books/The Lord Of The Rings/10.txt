After the feast (more or less) came the Speech. Most of
the company were, however, now in a tolerant mood, at that
delightful stage which they called ‘filling up the corners’.
They were sipping their favourite drinks, and nibbling at their
favourite dainties, and their fears were forgotten. They were
prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop.
My dear People, began Bilbo, rising in his place. ‘Hear!
Hear! Hear!’ they shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus,
seeming reluctant to follow their own advice. Bilbo left his
place and went and stood on a chair under the illuminated
tree. The light of the lanterns fell on his beaming face; the
golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat. They
could all see him standing, waving one hand in the air, the
other was in his trouser-pocket.
My dear Bagginses and Boffins, he began again; and my
dear Tooks and Brandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and
Burrowses, and Hornblowers, and Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Good-
bodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots. ‘Proudfeet!’ shouted an
elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion. His name, of
course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were large,
exceptionally furry, and both were on the table.
Proudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses
that I welcome back at last to Bag End. Today is my one hundred
and eleventh birthday: I am eleventy-one today! ‘Hurray! Hur-
ray! Many Happy Returns!’ they shouted, and they ham-
mered joyously on the tables. Bilbo was doing splendidly.
This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious.
I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. Deaf-
ening cheers. Cries of Yes (and No). Noises of trumpets and
horns, pipes and flutes, and other musical instruments. There
were, as has been said, many young hobbits present. Hun-
dreds of musical crackers had been pulled. Most of them
bore the mark dale on them; which did not convey much to
most of the hobbits, but they all agreed they were marvellous
crackers. They contained instruments, small, but of perfect
make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some of
the young Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo
to have finished (since he had plainly said all that was neces-
sary), now got up an impromptu orchestra, and began a
merry dance-tune. Master Everard Took and Miss Melilot
Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands
began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance, but rather
vigorous.
