‘But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the
same once. It’s not his now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I
say.’
Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. ‘You will be a fool if
you do, Bilbo,’ he said. ‘You make that clearer with every
word you say. It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go!
And then you can go yourself, and be free.’
‘I’ll do as I choose and go as I please,’ said Bilbo obstinately.

‘Now, now, my dear hobbit!’ said Gandalf. ‘All your long
life we have been friends, and you owe me something. Come!
Do as you promised: give it up!’
‘Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!’ cried Bilbo.
‘But you won’t get it. I won’t give my Precious away, I tell
you.’ His hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword.
Gandalf ’s eyes flashed. ‘It will be my turn to get angry
soon,’ he said. ‘If you say that again, I shall. Then you will
see Gandalf the Grey uncloaked.’ He took a step towards the
hobbit, and he seemed to grow tall and menacing; his shadow
filled the little room.
Bilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand
clutching at his pocket. They stood for a while facing one
another, and the air of the room tingled. Gandalf ’s eyes
remained bent on the hobbit. Slowly his hands relaxed, and
he began to tremble.
‘I don’t know what has come over you, Gandalf,’ he said.
‘You have never been like this before. What is it all about? It
is mine isn’t it? I found it, and Gollum would have killed me,
if I hadn’t kept it. I’m not a thief, whatever he said.’
‘I have never called you one,’ Gandalf answered. ‘And I
am not one either. I am not trying to rob you, but to help
you. I wish you would trust me, as you used.’ He turned
away, and the shadow passed. He seemed to dwindle again
to an old grey man, bent and troubled.
