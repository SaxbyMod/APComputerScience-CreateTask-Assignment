‘That is the signal for supper!’ said Bilbo. The pain and
alarm vanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to
their feet. There was a splendid supper for everyone; for
everyone, that is, except those invited to the special family
dinner-party. This was held in the great pavilion with the
tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number
also called by the hobbits one Gross, though the word was
not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were
selected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were
related, with the addition of a few special unrelated friends
(such as Gandalf ). Many young hobbits were included, and
present by parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going
with their children in the matter of sitting up late, especially
when there was a chance of getting them a free meal. Bringing
up young hobbits took a lot of provender.
There were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many
Tooks and Brandybucks; there were various Grubbs (re-
lations of Bilbo Baggins’ grandmother), and various Chubbs
(connexions of his Took grandfather); and a selection of
Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies,
Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very
distantly connected with Bilbo, and some had hardly ever
been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of
the Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho
and his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and
detested Frodo, but so magnificent was the invitation card,
written in golden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to
refuse. Besides, their cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing in
food for many years and his table had a high reputation.
All the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleas-
ant feast; though they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech
of their host (an inevitable item). He was liable to drag in bits
of what he called poetry; and sometimes, after a glass or
two, would allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious
journey. The guests were not disappointed: they had a very
pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich,
abundant, varied, and prolonged. The purchase of provisions
fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing
weeks; but as Bilbo’s catering had depleted the stocks of most
of the stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that
did not matter much.
