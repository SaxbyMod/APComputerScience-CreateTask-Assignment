Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the
darkness. ‘Good-bye, my dear Bilbo – until our next meet-
ing!’ he said softly and went back indoors.
Frodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in
the dark, deep in thought. ‘Has he gone?’ he asked.
‘Yes,’ answered Gandalf, ‘he has gone at last.’
‘I wish – I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only
a joke,’ said Frodo. ‘But I knew in my heart that he really
meant to go. He always used to joke about serious things. I
wish I had come back sooner, just to see him off.’
‘I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,’
said Gandalf. ‘Don’t be too troubled. He’ll be all right – now.
He left a packet for you. There it is!’
Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced
at it, but did not open it.
‘You’ll find his will and all the other documents in there, I
think,’ said the wizard. ‘You are the master of Bag End now.
And also, I fancy, you’ll find a golden ring.’
‘The ring!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘Has he left me that? I wonder
why. Still, it may be useful.’
‘It may, and it may not,’ said Gandalf. ‘I should not make
use of it, if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe!
Now I am going to bed.’
As master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say
good-bye to the guests. Rumours of strange events had by
now spread all over the field, but Frodo would only say no
doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning. About mid-
night carriages came for the important folk. One by one
they rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits.
Gardeners came by arrangement, and removed in wheel-
barrows those that had inadvertently remained behind.
