‘And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busy-
body,’ laughed Bilbo, ‘but I expect you know best, as usual.’
‘I do – when I know anything. But I don’t feel too sure
about this whole affair. It has now come to the final point.
You have had your joke, and alarmed or offended most of
your relations, and given the whole Shire something to talk
about for nine days, or ninety-nine more likely. Are you going
any further?’
‘Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as
I have told you before. Probably a permanent holiday: I don’t
expect I shall return. In fact, I don’t mean to, and I have
made all arrangements.
‘I am old, Gandalf. I don’t look it, but I am beginning
to feel it in my heart of hearts. Well-preserved indeed!’ he
snorted. ‘Why, I feel all thin, sort of stretched, if you know
what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much
bread. That can’t be right. I need a change, or something.’
Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him. ‘No, it does
not seem right,’ he said thoughtfully. ‘No, after all I believe
your plan is probably the best.’
‘Well, I’ve made up my mind, anyway. I want to see moun-
tains again, Gandalf – mountains; and then find somewhere
where I can rest. In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives
prying around, and a string of confounded visitors hanging
on the bell. I might find somewhere where I can finish my
book. I have thought of a nice ending for it: and he lived
happily ever after to the end of his days.’
Gandalf laughed. ‘I hope he will. But nobody will read the
book, however it ends.’
‘Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some
already, as far as it has gone. You’ll keep an eye on Frodo,
won’t you?’
‘Yes, I will – two eyes, as often as I can spare them.’
‘He would come with me, of course, if I asked him. In fact
he offered to once, just before the party. But he does not
really want to, yet. I want to see the wild country again before
I die, and the Mountains; but he is still in love with the
Shire, with woods and fields and little rivers. He ought to be
comfortable here. I am leaving everything to him, of course,
except a few oddments. I hope he will be happy, when he
gets used to being on his own. It’s time he was his own master
now.’
