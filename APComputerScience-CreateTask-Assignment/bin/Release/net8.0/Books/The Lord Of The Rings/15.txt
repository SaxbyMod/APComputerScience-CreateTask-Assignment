‘Everything?’ said Gandalf. ‘The ring as well? You agreed
to that, you remember.’
‘Well, er, yes, I suppose so,’ stammered Bilbo.
‘Where is it?’
‘In an envelope, if you must know,’ said Bilbo impatiently.
‘There on the mantelpiece. Well, no! Here it is in my
pocket!’ He hesitated. ‘Isn’t that odd now?’ he said softly
to himself. ‘Yet after all, why not? Why shouldn’t it stay
there?’
Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a
gleam in his eyes. ‘I think, Bilbo,’ he said quietly, ‘I should
leave it behind. Don’t you want to?’
‘Well yes – and no. Now it comes to it, I don’t like parting
with it at all, I may say. And I don’t really see why I should.
Why do you want me to?’ he asked, and a curious change
came over his voice. It was sharp with suspicion and annoy-
ance. ‘You are always badgering me about my ring; but you
have never bothered me about the other things that I got on
my journey.’
‘No, but I had to badger you,’ said Gandalf. ‘I wanted the
truth. It was important. Magic rings are – well, magical; and
they are rare and curious. I was professionally interested in
your ring, you may say; and I still am. I should like to know
where it is, if you go wandering again. Also I think you have
had it quite long enough. You won’t need it any more, Bilbo,
unless I am quite mistaken.’
Bilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His
kindly face grew hard. ‘Why not?’ he cried. ‘And what
business is it of yours, anyway, to know what I do with my
own things? It is my own. I found it. It came to me.’
‘Yes, yes,’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is no need to get angry.’
‘If I am it is your fault,’ said Bilbo. ‘It is mine, I tell you.
My own. My Precious. Yes, my Precious.’
The wizard’s face remained grave and attentive, and only
a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and
indeed alarmed. ‘It has been called that before,’ he said, ‘but
not by you.’
