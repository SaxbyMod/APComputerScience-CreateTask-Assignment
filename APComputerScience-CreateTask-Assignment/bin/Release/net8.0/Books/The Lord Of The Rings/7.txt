One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south
of Bilbo’s front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents
and pavilions. A special entrance was cut into the bank
leading to the road, and wide steps and a large white gate
were built there. The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row,
adjoining the field, were intensely interested and generally
envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work
in his garden.
The tents began to go up. There was a specially large
pavilion, so big that the tree that grew in the field was right
inside it, and stood proudly near one end, at the head of
the chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its branches.
More promising still (to the hobbits’ mind): an enormous

open-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field.
A draught of cooks, from every inn and eating-house for
miles around, arrived to supplement the dwarves and other
odd folk that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose to
its height.
Then the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday
the eve of the Party. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday,
September the 22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, the
clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun began.
Bilbo Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety
of entertainments rolled into one. Practically everybody living
near was invited. A very few were overlooked by accident,
but as they turned up all the same, that did not matter. Many
people from other parts of the Shire were also asked; and
there were even a few from outside the borders. Bilbo met
the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person.
He gave away presents to all and sundry – the latter were
those who went out again by a back way and came in again
by the gate. Hobbits give presents to other people on their
own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not
so lavishly as on this occasion; but it was not a bad system.
Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year was
somebody’s birthday, so that every hobbit in those parts had
a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week. But
they never got tired of them.
