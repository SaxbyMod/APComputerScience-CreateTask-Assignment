Bilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set
it by the clock, his hand jerked back, and the packet fell on
the floor. Before he could pick it up, the wizard stooped and
seized it and set it in its place. A spasm of anger passed
swiftly over the hobbit’s face again. Suddenly it gave way to
a look of relief and a laugh.
‘Well, that’s that,’ he said. ‘Now I’m off !’
They went out into the hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick
from the stand; then he whistled. Three dwarves came out
of different rooms where they had been busy.
‘Is everything ready?’ asked Bilbo. ‘Everything packed and
labelled?’
‘Everything,’ they answered.
‘Well, let’s start then!’ He stepped out of the front-door.
It was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars.
He looked up, sniffing the air. ‘What fun! What fun to be off
again, off on the Road with dwarves! This is what I have
really been longing for, for years! Good-bye!’ he said, looking
at his old home and bowing to the door. ‘Good-bye, Gandalf !’
‘Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself !
You are old enough, and perhaps wise enough.’
‘Take care! I don’t care. Don’t you worry about me! I am
as happy now as I have ever been, and that is saying a great
deal. But the time has come. I am being swept off my feet at
last,’ he added, and then in a low voice, as if to himself, he
sang softly in the dark:
The Road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can,
Pursuing it with eager feet,
Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say.
He paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word
he turned away from the lights and voices in the field and
tents, and followed by his three companions went round
into his garden, and trotted down the long sloping path. He
jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom, and took
to the meadows, passing into the night like a rustle of wind
in the grass.
