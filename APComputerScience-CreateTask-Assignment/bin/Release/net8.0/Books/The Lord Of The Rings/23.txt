‘You’ll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn’t you go
too? You don’t belong here; you’re no Baggins – you – you’re
a Brandybuck!’
‘Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,’
said Frodo as he shut the door on her.
‘It was a compliment,’ said Merry Brandybuck, ‘and so, of
course, not true.’
Then they went round the hole, and evicted three young
hobbits (two Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes
in the walls of one of the cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with
young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot’s grandson),
who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry, where he
thought there was an echo. The legend of Bilbo’s gold excited
both curiosity and hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously
obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is, as everyone knows,
anyone’s for the finding – unless the search is interrupted.
When he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out,
Frodo collapsed on a chair in the hall. ‘It’s time to close the
shop, Merry,’ he said. ‘Lock the door, and don’t open it to
anyone today, not even if they bring a battering ram.’ Then
he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea.
He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at
the front-door. ‘Lobelia again most likely,’ he thought. ‘She
must have thought of something really nasty, and have come
back again to say it. It can wait.’
He went on with his tea. The knock was repeated, much
louder, but he took no notice. Suddenly the wizard’s head
appeared at the window.
‘If you don’t let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right
down your hole and out through the hill,’ he said.
‘My dear Gandalf ! Half a minute!’ cried Frodo, running
out of the room to the door. ‘Come in! Come in! I thought it
was Lobelia.’
‘Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, driving
a pony-trap towards Bywater with a face that would have
curdled new milk.’
‘She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly
tried on Bilbo’s ring. I longed to disappear.’
‘Don’t do that!’ said Gandalf, sitting down. ‘Do be careful
of that ring, Frodo! In fact, it is partly about that that I have
come to say a last word.’
