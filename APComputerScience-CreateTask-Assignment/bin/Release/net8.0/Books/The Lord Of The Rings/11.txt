But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster
nearby, he blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. I shall
not keep you long, he cried. Cheers from all the assembly. I
have called you all together for a Purpose. Something in the
way that he said this made an impression. There was almost
silence, and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears.
Indeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am
immensely fond of you all, and that eleventy-one years is too
short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits.
Tremendous outburst of approval.
I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I
like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. This was
unexpected and rather difficult. There was some scattered
clapping, but most of them were trying to work it out and
see if it came to a compliment.
Secondly, to celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. I should
say: OUR birthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my
heir and nephew, Frodo. He comes of age and into his inheritance
today. Some perfunctory clapping by the elders; and some
loud shouts of ‘Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old Frodo,’ from the
juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and wondered
what was meant by ‘coming into his inheritance’.
Together we score one hundred and forty-four. Your numbers
were chosen to fit this remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use
the expression. No cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of the
guests, and especially the Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted,
feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up the required
number, like goods in a package. ‘One Gross, indeed! Vulgar
expression.’
It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the
anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long
Lake; though the fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory
on that occasion. I was only fifty-one then, and birthdays did not
seem so important. The banquet was very splendid, however,
though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and could only
say ‘thag you very buch’. I now repeat it more correctly: Thank
you very much for coming to my little party. Obstinate silence.
They all feared that a song or some poetry was now immi-
nent; and they were getting bored. Why couldn’t he stop
talking and let them drink his health? But Bilbo did not sing
or recite. He paused for a moment.
