‘You shouldn’t listen to all you hear, Sandyman,’ said the
Gaffer, who did not much like the miller. ‘There isn’t no call
to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky
enough for those that sit still without looking further for the
cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo left an
orphan and stranded, as you might say, among those queer
Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A
regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never
had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place.
Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the
lad back to live among decent folk.
‘But I reckon it was a nasty knock for those Sackville-
Bagginses. They thought they were going to get Bag End,
that time when he went off and was thought to be dead. And
then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes on
living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him!
And suddenly he produces an heir, and has all the papers
made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won’t never see
the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.’
‘There’s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear
tell,’ said a stranger, a visitor on business from Michel
Delving in the Westfarthing. ‘All the top of your hill is full of
tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver, and jools, by
what I’ve heard.’
‘Then you’ve heard more than I can speak to,’ answered
the Gaffer. ‘I know nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with
his money, and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no
tunnel-making. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter
of sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I’d not long come
prentice to old Holman (him being my dad’s cousin), but he
had me up at Bag End helping him to keep folks from tram-
pling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was
on. And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up the Hill
with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests.
I don’t doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked
up in foreign parts, where there be mountains of gold, they
say; but there wasn’t enough to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam
will know more about that. He’s in and out of Bag End.
Crazy about stories of the old days, he is, and he listens to
all Mr. Bilbo’s tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters –
meaning no harm, mark you, and I hope no harm will come of it.
