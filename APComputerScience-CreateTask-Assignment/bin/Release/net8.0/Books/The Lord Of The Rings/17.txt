Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. ‘I am sorry,’ he said.
‘But I felt so queer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not
to be bothered with it any more. It has been so growing on
my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was like an eye
looking at me. And I am always wanting to put it on and
disappear, don’t you know; or wondering if it is safe, and
pulling it out to make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found
I couldn’t rest without it in my pocket. I don’t know why.

And I don’t seem able to make up my mind.’
‘Then trust mine,’ said Gandalf. ‘It is quite made up. Go
away and leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo,
and I will look after him.’
Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently
he sighed. ‘All right,’ he said with an effort. ‘I will.’ Then he
shrugged his shoulders, and smiled rather ruefully. ‘After all
that’s what this party business was all about, really: to give
away lots of birthday-presents, and somehow make it easier
to give it away at the same time. It hasn’t made it any easier
in the end, but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations.
It would quite spoil the joke.’
‘Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the
affair,’ said Gandalf.
‘Very well,’ said Bilbo, ‘it goes to Frodo with all the rest.’
He drew a deep breath. ‘And now I really must be starting,
or somebody else will catch me. I have said good-bye, and I
couldn’t bear to do it all over again.’ He picked up his bag
and moved to the door.
‘You have still got the ring in your pocket,’ said the wizard.
‘Well, so I have!’ cried Bilbo. ‘And my will and all the other
documents too. You had better take it and deliver it for me.
That will be safest.’
‘No, don’t give the ring to me,’ said Gandalf. ‘Put it on the
mantelpiece. It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes. I
shall wait for him.’
