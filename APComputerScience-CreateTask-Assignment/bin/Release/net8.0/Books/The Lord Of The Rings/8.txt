On this occasion the presents were unusually good. The
hobbit-children were so excited that for a while they almost
forgot about eating. There were toys the like of which they
had never seen before, all beautiful and some obviously magi-
cal. Many of them had indeed been ordered a year before,
and had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale,
and were of real dwarf-make.
When every guest had been welcomed and was finally
inside the gate, there were songs, dances, music, games, and,
of course, food and drink. There were three official meals:
lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper). But lunch and tea were
marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the guests
were sitting down and eating together. At other times there
were merely lots of people eating and drinking – continuously
from elevenses until six-thirty, when the fireworks started.
The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought
by him, but designed and made by him; and the special
effects, set pieces, and flights of rockets were let off by
him. But there was also a generous distribution of squibs,
crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, elf-
fountains, goblin-barkers and thunder-claps. They were all
superb. The art of Gandalf improved with age.
There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing
with sweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark
smoke: their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a
moment, and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers
down upon the astonished hobbits, disappearing with a sweet
scent just before they touched their upturned faces. There
were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees;
there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into
eagles, or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there
was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; there
was a forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air
with a yell like an embattled army, and came down again into
the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. And there
was also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled
the hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf intended. The lights went
out. A great smoke went up. It shaped itself like a mountain
seen in the distance, and began to glow at the summit. It
spouted green and scarlet flames. Out flew a red-golden
dragon – not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his
jaws, his eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed
three times over the heads of the crowd. They all ducked,
and many fell flat on their faces. The dragon passed like an
express train, turned a somersault, and burst over Bywater
with a deafening explosion.
