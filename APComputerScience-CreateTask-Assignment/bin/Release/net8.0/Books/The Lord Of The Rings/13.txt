As for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech,
he had been fingering the golden ring in his pocket: his magic
ring that he had kept secret for so many years. As he stepped
down he slipped it on his finger, and he was never seen by
any hobbit in Hobbiton again.
He walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment
listening with a smile to the din in the pavilion, and to the
sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field. Then he
went in. He took off his party clothes, folded up and wrapped
in tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat, and put it
away. Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments,
and fastened round his waist a worn leather belt. On it he
hung a short sword in a battered black-leather scabbard.
From a locked drawer, smelling of moth-balls, he took
out an old cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if
they were very precious, but they were so patched and
weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be
guessed: it might have been dark green. They were rather too
large for him. He then went into his study, and from a large
strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a
leather-bound manuscript; and also a large bulky envelope.
The book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag
that was standing there, already nearly full. Into the enve-
lope he slipped his golden ring, and its fine chain, and then
sealed it, and addressed it to Frodo. At first he put it on the
mantelpiece, but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his
pocket. At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came
quickly in.
‘Hullo!’ said Bilbo. ‘I wondered if you would turn up.’
‘I am glad to find you visible,’ replied the wizard, sitting
down in a chair, ‘I wanted to catch you and have a few
final words. I suppose you feel that everything has gone off
splendidly and according to plan?’
‘Yes, I do,’ said Bilbo. ‘Though that flash was surprising:
it quite startled me, let alone the others. A little addition of
your own, I suppose?’
‘It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years,
and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests something
else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment.’
