Thirdly and finally, he said, I wish to make an
ANNOUNCEMENT. He spoke this last word so loudly and
suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. I regret to
announce that – though, as I said, eleventy-one years is far too
short a time to spend among you – this is the END. I am going.
I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!
He stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash
of light, and the guests all blinked. When they opened their
eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be seen. One hundred and forty-
four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo
Proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped.
Then there was a dead silence, until suddenly, after several
deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took, Brandybuck,
Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brockhouse,
Goodbody, Hornblower, and Proudfoot began to talk at once.
It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste,
and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of
shock and annoyance. ‘He’s mad. I always said so,’ was
probably the most popular comment. Even the Tooks (with
a few exceptions) thought Bilbo’s behaviour was absurd. For
the moment most of them took it for granted that his
disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank.
But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor
an enormous dinner had clouded his wits, and he said to his
daughter-in-law, Esmeralda: ‘There’s something fishy in this,
my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off again. Silly old
fool. But why worry? He hasn’t taken the vittles with him.’
He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again.
Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For
some time he had sat silent beside Bilbo’s empty chair, and
ignored all remarks and questions. He had enjoyed the joke,
of course, even though he had been in the know. He had
difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise
of the guests. But at the same time he felt deeply troubled:
he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly. Most
of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing
Bilbo Baggins’ oddities, past and present; but the Sackville-
Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo did not want
to have any more to do with the party. He gave orders for
more wine to be served; then he got up and drained his own
glass silently to the health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the
pavilion.
