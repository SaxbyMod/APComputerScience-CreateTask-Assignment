Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather
later. Morning went on. People came and began (by orders)
to clear away the pavilions and the tables and the chairs, and
the spoons and knives and bottles and plates, and the lanterns,
and the flowering shrubs in boxes, and the crumbs and
cracker-paper, the forgotten bags and gloves and handker-
chiefs, and the uneaten food (a very small item). Then a
number of other people came (without orders): Bagginses,
and Boffins, and Bolgers, and Tooks, and other guests that
lived or were staying near. By mid-day, when even the best-
fed were out and about again, there was a large crowd at Bag
End, uninvited but not unexpected.
Frodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather
tired and worried. He welcomed all the callers, but he had
not much more to say than before. His reply to all inquiries
was simply this: ‘Mr. Bilbo Baggins has gone away; as far as
I know, for good.’ Some of the visitors he invited to come
inside, as Bilbo had left ‘messages’ for them.
Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of
packages and parcels and small articles of furniture. On every
item there was a label tied. There were several labels of this
sort:
For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo; on 
an umbrella. Adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones.
For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspon-
dence, with love from Bilbo; on a large waste-paper basket.
Dora was Drogo’s sister and the eldest surviving female rela-
tive of Bilbo and Frodo; she was ninety-nine, and had written
reams of good advice for more than half a century.
For MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B.;
on a gold pen and ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters.
For ANGELICA’S use, from Uncle Bilbo; on a round convex
mirror. She was a young Baggins, and too obviously con-
sidered her face shapely.
For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a con-
tributor; on an (empty) book-case. Hugo was a great borrower
of books, and worse than usual at returning them.
