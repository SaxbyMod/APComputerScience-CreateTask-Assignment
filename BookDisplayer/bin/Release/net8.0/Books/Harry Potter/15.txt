"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall," said Dumbledore, 
nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. 
 
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he 
stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and 
twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet 
Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking 
around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the 
bundle of blankets on the step of number four. 
 
"Good luck, Harry," he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish 
of his cloak, he was gone. 
 
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and 
tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect 
astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his 
blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside 
him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was 
famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs. 
Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk 
bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and 
pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very 
moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up 
their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "To Harry Potter -- the boy 
who lived!"
