His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed 
as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.

"You are to be congratulated," I remarked, considerably surprised at his enthusiasm.

"There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfurt last year. He would certainly have 
been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the 
notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of New Orleans. I could name 
a score of cases in which it would have been decisive."

"You seem to be a walking calendar of crime," said Stamford with a laugh. "You might
start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police News of the Past.’ ”

"Very interesting reading it might be made, too," remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking 
a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. "I have to be careful," he 
continued, turning to me with a smile, "for I dabble with poisons a good deal." He 
held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with 
similar pieces of plaster and discolored with strong acids.

"We came here on business," said Stamford, sitting down on a high three-legged stool 
and pushing another one in my direction with his foot. "My friend here wants to take 
diggings, and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you,
I thought that I had better bring you together."

Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me. "I have my 
eye on a suite in Baker Street," he said, "which would suit us down to the ground. 
You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?"

"I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself," I answered.

"That’s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do 
experiments. Would that annoy you?"

"By no means."
